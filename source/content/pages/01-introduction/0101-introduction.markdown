# Introduction
You're an experienced programmer with a language or two under your belt. You
keep hearing amazing compliments from the smartest developers you know about 
this little language called Clojure. The functional programming style is 
something you've been meaning to better understand for awhile, so why not

Clojure is a functional, dynamically typed language with a syntax influenced by
LISP. Compiled Clojure programs run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) just
like a Java or Scala application.

This guide branches out on topic to lead you to the appropriate topics based 
on what you're trying to accomplish with Clojure.
