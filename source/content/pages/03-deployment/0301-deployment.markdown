# Deployment
Deployment involves packaging up your Clojure code as a .war (Web 
application ARchive) file then deploying it on a web application server running
on a server or platform-as-a-service.


## Why is deployment necessary?
Your web application must live somewhere other than your own desktop or 
laptop. A production environment is the canonical version of your current 
application and its associated data.

* [Thoughts on web application deployment](http://omniti.com/seeds/thoughts-on-web-application-deployment)
  walks through deploying apps with source control, continuous deployment and
  monitoring.

* [Practical continuous deployment](http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/04/practical-continuous-deployment/)
  defines delivery versus deployment and walks through a continuous deployment
  workflow.
