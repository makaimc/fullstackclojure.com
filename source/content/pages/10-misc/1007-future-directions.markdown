# Future Directions
I created Full Stack Clojure because the positive reaction for 
[Full Stack Python](http://www.fullstackpython.com/) made me hopeful that
I could apply a similar approach with the Clojure community.

This short section lays out my thoughts on what I'm working to improve in the
intermediate-to-long term. Full Stack Clojure will be my second priority in
2014 behind Full Stack Python. Therefore it's likely this site will grow slowly
for the first few months before I can put greater emphasis on fleshing out
every section.

These plans can change based on 
[pull requests](https://github.com/makaimc/fullstackclojure.github.com/pulls)
and 
[issue tickets](https://github.com/makaimc/fullstackpython.github.com/issues) 
from the community. I work to integrate PRs within a day so please 
submit one when you see a fix or improvement that needs to be made!

Here are some things I'm actively working on:

* Creating basic sections for web applications, deployments and builds.

* Adding my backlog of resources I've been collecting into appropriate 
  sections.


### That's what coming. What would you like to learn right now?
