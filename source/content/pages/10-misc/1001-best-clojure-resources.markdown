# Best Clojure Resources
Your best best for learning Clojure is to use a mixture of free resources
combined with buying a few recommended books.

This is the list I wish I had when I was originally learning Clojure.


## Clojure books
* I found working through example programs while reading
  [Programming Clojure](http://pragprog.com/book/shcloj2/programming-clojure)
  to be the fastest way for me to grasp the basic Clojure syntax. It looks
  even the 2nd edition of the book is out of date since it only covers 
  Clojure 1.3 so hopefully a third edition will be released to cover 
  version 1.4.

* [Clojure in Action](http://www.manning.com/rathore/) by Manning Books is
  also a few years out of date but still useful for learning the basic
  language. If the book is revised it will definitely be one to pick up.


## Clojure web resources
* [Clojure - Functional Programming for the JVM](http://java.ociweb.com/mark/clojure/article.html)
  is an incrediblely detailed walkthrough. The article is considered one of,
  if not the best, Clojure tutorial on the web.


* [Learn Clojure in y minutes](http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/clojure/)
  provides a whirlwind tour of the Clojure language. The guide is primarily
  useful when you're coming in with previous software development experience
  and want to quickly grasp how the language's syntax is structured.


## Videos, screencasts and presentations
* The [ClojureTV](https://www.youtube.com/user/ClojureTV) channel on YouTube
  aggregates Clojure focused talks from conferences and meetups around the
  world.


## Newsletters
* [(def newsletter)](http://defnewsletter.com/) is a free weekly roundup
  of the latest Clojure articles, videos, projects, and upcoming events. 
  However, it looks like the newsletter has been on hiatus since the end
  of October 2013, so the 
  [archive](http://us2.campaign-archive2.com/home/?u=62fb70be840779d7af85e9b6e&id=4951b7aa7c)
  may be your best bet.

* [Clojure Gazette](http://www.clojuregazette.com/) is another free weekly
  articles collection. Likewise it appears there are no new issues since the
  end of 2013 but the [archive](http://www.clojuregazette.com/archive.html) is
  a great place to look for relevant Clojure content.


### Those resources should help get you started. What's next?
