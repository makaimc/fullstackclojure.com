# Web frameworks
A web application framework is a code library that make a developer's life
easier when building reliable, scalable and maintainable web applications.


## Why are web frameworks necessary?
Web frameworks encapsulate what developers have learned over the past twenty
years while building dynamic web applications. Frameworks make it easier
to reuse code for common HTTP operations and to structure your code so that 
it is maintainable.


## Web frameworks learning checklist
<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> 
Choose an actively developed Clojure web framework such as 
[Compojure](/compojure.html) and stick with it for your initial web 
applications.

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> 
Work through a detailed tutorial found within the resources links on the
framework's page.

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> 
Study open source examples built with your framework of choice so you can 
take parts of those projects and reuse the code in your application.

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> 
Build the first simple iteration of your web application then go to
the [deployment](/deployment.html) section to make it accessible on the 
web.


## Common web framework functionality
Frameworks provide functionality in their code or through extensions to 
perform common operations required to run web applications. These common 
operations include:

1. URL routing
2. HTML, XML, JSON, and other output format templating
3. Database manipulation
4. Security against Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and other attacks

Not all web frameworks include code for all of the above 
functionality. Frameworks fall somewhere between simply executing a 
single use case and attempting to be everything to every developer with
increased complexity. Some frameworks take the "batteries-included" approach 
where everything possible comes bundled with the framework while others 
have a minimal code library that plays well with extensions.


## General web framework resources
* Stack Overflow's answer on 
  [Clojure web application frameworks](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3325033/comparison-of-clojure-web-frameworks) 
  is a few years out of date but still interesting to learn what frameworks
  are still relevant after several years.

* Check out the answer to the 
  "[What is a web framework and how does it compare to LAMP?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4507506/what-is-a-web-framework-how-does-it-compare-with-lamp)"
  question on Stack Overflow.
